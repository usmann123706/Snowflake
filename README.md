and creating a dashboard for insightful analysis.
# Fetching Data
1)Visit Marketplace to access restaurant public data  
2)Follow the instructions on the marketplace to obtain the necessary data  
3)Save the data locally for further processing  
# Snowflake Configuration
1)Create a Snowflake account if you don't have one  
2)Set up a virtual warehouse for data processing  
3)Configure Snowflake internal stage for seamless data loading  
# Data Processing
